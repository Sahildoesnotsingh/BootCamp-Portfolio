# BootCamp-Portfolio
All projects from the first phase of the high school tech immersion program, 2024
Hi, Im Sahil Singh, a 16 year old going to grade 11. I am very new to the tech sector and took this program to learn more and possibly find a career in the technology sector, Below are the projects I have worked on/completed in the bootcamp.

I Coded a number guessing game which has the user guess a number between 1-10 til they get the number the computer is thinking. Added features such as asking if the user wants to play again and making sure if user inputs something out of the range it will have the computer tell the user that that is not a valid guess. Used Replit and Python.

I Coded a calculator which uses the four operations and will send a error message if you try and divide by 0, code is very similar to number guessing game but is longer. Used Replit and Python.

I Designed a logo using canva for a made up buisness called "Washaway" which is a company that produces the most exotic tropical drinks that has you hydrated anytime and anywhere.

I Had also created a poster for said made up buisness highlighting their signatures and the limited deals the store has to offer to them. This was used from a blank template in Canva.
