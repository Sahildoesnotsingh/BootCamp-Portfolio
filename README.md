# BootCamp-Portfolio
All projects from the first phase of the high school tech immersion program, 2024
Hi, Im Sahil Singh, a 16 year old going to grade 11. I am very new to the tech sector and took this program to learn more and possibly find a career in the technology sector, Below are the projects I have worked on/completed in the bootcamp.
## Number-Guessing-Game
I Coded a number guessing game which has the user guess a number between 1-10 til they get the number the computer is thinking. Added features such as asking if the user wants to play again and making sure if user inputs something out of the range it will have the computer tell the user that that is not a valid guess. Used Replit and Python.
### Number-Guessing Game Feature
1. Allows for the user to try again with a simple y/n UI

## Pyhton-Calculator
I Coded a calculator which uses the four operations and will send a error message if you try and divide by 0, code is very similar to number guessing game but is longer. Used Replit and Python.
### Calculator Bugs
1.Cannot divide by 0, results in error

2.only can calculate two number inputs

3. Open to be able to add more features on the calculator

## Logo
I Designed a logo using canva for a made up buisness called "Washaway" which is a company that produces the most exotic tropical drinks that has you hydrated anytime and anywhere.

## Data Visualization
I created graphs in python using data libraries that I have imported from, The first Image represents a bar graph of men and woman ordering in a resturant and out of a certain number of them, who had to pay the resturant more.

The image below shows the relations between the sepal and petal's widths and lengths when growing. The number closer to 1 shows that the two variables attached to that value both increase their number.

I would love to be able to add my own custom colours and create more different graphs with each set of data. I would also be interested to learn to code an interactable graph as well.


## Poster
I Had also created a poster for said made up buisness highlighting their signatures and the limited deals the store has to offer to them. This was used from a blank
template in Canva.

## Data Visualization(My own data)
The graph below is made up of Data I had put in rather then extracted from another data library. It is a heatmap that shows which variables Increase eating snacks and what variables decrease eating snacks along with their correlation to each other and see which varaibles make each other better. The purpose of this graph was to fix my eating habits and do other things that will distract me from eating my heart out.

I learned that going outside more often and drinking more water are the best ways to make sure I do not eat so much food from looking at the heatmap above.
## Project Management
The certificate below shows the completion of the Project Management Course found on the Pinnguaq website. This certificate proves my knowledge of the two types of ways a project can be Handled from (Projects In Controlled Enviorments) PRINCE2 (Which falls under the waterfall method) and Scrum(falls under the agile method)

## Squishy's aMAZEing Stroll
A Game that follows a small snail by the name of Squishy, He's out for a nice walk but he has to watch for pesky children who never watch their steps around him. He finds a marble which he immediately loses so help him find it and avoid the children! It might seem like a small reward but there could be more :)

### Bugs with the game
1. The lily tile kills all enemies, even the ones that did not touch the lily tile, it should only kill the enemy who touched the lily
2. The chest which if touched unlocks the secret ending, however the game does not end when you hit the chesss, only the marble. You must touch both chest and marble to get this ending which is not how I want it to be designed. If it would be designed like this I would like it so you would have to not die in order to touch the marble after the chest unlocking the secret ending because if you die after touching the chest, you are back to the start and can still touch the marble granting the secret ending. I would not like to give a gameover to the player, just for the player to have to touch both marble and chest in one go without dieing.
3. Also would like a way to make the secret exit area not visible until you go through the entrance
